# script_whitelist
A fully functioning backend for a ROBLOX script whitelist. I've also provided my semi-finished discord bot I made for managing it. The bot also comes with basic admin tools.

All examples of how to use the API are in the examples folder.

The discord bot requires: node-fetch, discord.js
